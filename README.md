This project implements a machine learning-based approach for detecting fake news using Python and the scikit-learn library. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data and classify news articles as either genuine or fake. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF, and training various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. The project evaluates the performance of these models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics to identify the best-performing model. This tool aims to provide an effective solution for combating misinformation in online news.
